    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These moist Vanilla Cupcakes are super easy to make and 
        so moist - for days! They are my new favorite vanilla 
        cupcake.</p>
        <p>*Some people report having issues with these cupcakes.
         If that happens to you, could try leaving out the water
          entirely.</p>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (176°C) and prepare a cupcake pan with liners.</li>
                <li>Add the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt to a large mixer bowl and combine. Set aside.</li>  
                <li> Add the milk, vegetable oil, vanilla extract and eggs to a medium sized bowl and combine.</li>  
                <li>Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and beat until well combined.</li>  
                <li>Slowly add the water to the batter and mix on low speed until well combined. Scrape down the 
                    sides of the bowl as needed to make sure everything is well combined. Please note that the 
                    batter will be very thin.</li>  
                <li>Fill the cupcake liners about half way and bake for 15-17 minutes, or until a toothpick comes 
                    out with a few moist crumbs.</li>  
                <li>Remove the cupcakes from oven and allow to cool for 2 minutes, then remove to a cooling rack 
                    to finish cooling.</li>  
                <li>To make the frosting, beat the butter in a large mixer bowl until smooth.</li>  
                <li>Add 2 cups of powdered sugar and mix until smooth.</li>  
                <li>Add the vanilla extract and 1 tablespoon of water or milk and mix until smooth.</li>  
                <li>Add remaining powdered sugar and mix until smooth.</li>  
                <li>Add remaining water or milk, as needed, and salt and mix until smooth.</li>  
                <li>Pipe the frosting onto the cupcakes.</li>            
            </ol>
